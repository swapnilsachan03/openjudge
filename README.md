# OpenJudge

OpenJudge is my attempt to develop a web-based code judging system where users can practice problems using various languages.

My main goal & motivation for working on this project is not to reach as many people as possible, there are many good coding platforms already out there for that, many of which I myself use frequently, but to get a deep understanding of how complex backend systems work and how can we solve real problems.

Thus the main reason to pursue this project for me is that I don't know where to start with this project, so I'll be figuring out the entire approach from start to end that I'll follow to solve this problem.

### Technologies Used

- __Frontend:__ React, React Router, Tailwind CSS
- __Backend:__ NodeJS, Express, MongoDB
